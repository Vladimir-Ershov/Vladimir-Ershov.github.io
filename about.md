# About Me

Welcome to my AI research blog! I'm Vladimir Ershov, a researcher and engineer passionate about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cognitive computing.

## Research Interests

My work focuses on the intersection of AI and human cognition, exploring how we can build more intelligent and interpretable systems. I'm particularly interested in:

- **Machine Learning Implementations**: Building and understanding ML models from scratch
- **AI Cognition & Consciousness**: Exploring the philosophical and practical aspects of artificial intelligence
- **Robotics & Embodied AI**: Working on challenges like the BEHAVIOR benchmark for household robotics
- **Language Models**: Understanding and improving LLMs for practical applications
- **Schema-Guided Reasoning**: Developing structured approaches to AI problem-solving

## Current Projects

### MLRecap
A collection of machine learning reimplementations where I rebuild fundamental ML algorithms and models from scratch. This project helps me (and hopefully you) understand the inner workings of these powerful tools.

### BEHAVIOR Challenge Research
Exploring solutions for complex household robotics tasks, including high-level planning and low-level control in realistic simulation environments.

### AI Coding Agents
Investigating schema-guided reasoning patterns and structured approaches for building more capable AI coding assistants.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog serves as a platform for:

- **Research Paper Reviews**: Deep dives into important AI/ML papers
- **Implementation Guides**: Step-by-step walkthroughs of ML algorithms
- **Interactive Demos**: Hands-on experiments you can run in your browser
- **Technical Notes**: Insights and learnings from my research journey
- **Open Source Projects**: Code and tools for the community

## Philosophy

I believe in:

- **Learning by Building**: The best way to understand something is to build it yourself
- **Open Science**: Sharing knowledge and code to advance the field together
- **Practical Theory**: Bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world applications
- **Accessible AI**: Making complex concepts understandable for everyone
